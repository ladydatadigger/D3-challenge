# D3-challenge

Analyzed the current trends based on health risks facing particular demographics. 

The data set is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates: [https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml). The current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."

 **html** and **Javascript** 

Created an interactive scatter plot between two of the data variables such as `Healthcare vs. Poverty` or `Smokers vs. Age`. The scatter plot represents each state with circle elements. 

* Note: You'll need to use `python -m http.server` to run the visualization. This will host the page at `localhost:8000` in your web browser.
